#   based development environment of an Invenio-based software.

# Usage:
# - Write parameters that you would give to a 'git clone' command to
#   one single line.
# - Give at least a URL to a git-repository
#   (e.g. https://github.com/cernopendata/cernopendata-theme.git)
# - Supports all parameters that can be passed to 'git clone'.
#   E.g. to checkout a specific branch after cloning input:
#   '-b <BRANCH_NAME> <REPOSITORY_URL>'
# - Use '#' to comment out lines so they won't be processed by the downloader.
